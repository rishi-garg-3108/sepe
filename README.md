# 🎓 SEPE – Student Enrollment Prediction Engine

SEPE (Student Enrollment Prediction Engine) is an end-to-end Machine Learning project that predicts the probability of a lead converting into a paid student enrollment for an EdTech platform offering online coding classes. 

---

## 🚀 Project Objective

The goal of SEPE is to:

- Analyze lead information (student + parent details)
- Predict the **probability of conversion** (enrollment)
- Help marketing teams focus ad spend on **high-potential leads**

This reflects a real-world EdTech growth and marketing optimization use case.

## 🧠 Key ML Concepts Covered

- Real-world feature engineering (based on EdTech domain experience)
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Robust preprocessing pipelines
- Train / validation / test split
- Logistic Regression baseline model
- Evaluation using ROC-AUC and Accuracy
- Explainability and threshold-based decision making
- Production-style project structure

# ⚙️ Tech Stack

- Python 3.9+
- pandas, numpy
- scikit-learn
- joblib
- uv (virtual environment & dependency management)

---

## 🛠️ Environment Setup (Using `uv`)
```bash 
uv pip install

### 1️⃣ Create virtual environment

From project root:

```bash
uv venv

### 2️⃣ Activate the environment
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
